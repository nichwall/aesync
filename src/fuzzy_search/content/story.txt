Chantal Trescothik looked at the enchanted teapot in her hands and felt sneezy.
She walked over to the window and reflected on her pretty surroundings. She had always loved deserted Cambridge with its clever, colorful cliffs. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel sneezy.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Sophia Ball. Sophia was a scheming painter with grubby lips and vast elbows.
Chantal gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a giving, adorable, tea drinker with ample lips and beautiful elbows. Her friends saw her as an elated, excited elephant. Once, she had even jumped into a river and saved a black disabled person.
But not even a giving person who had once jumped into a river and saved a black disabled person, was prepared for what Sophia had in store today.
The drizzle rained like shouting rabbits, making Chantal jumpy.
As Chantal stepped outside and Sophia came closer, she could see the aggressive smile on her face.
"Look Chantal," growled Sophia, with a hilarious glare that reminded Chantal of scheming ostriches. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want a pencil. You owe me 787 dollars."
Chantal looked back, even more jumpy and still fingering the enchanted teapot. "Sophia, eat my shorts," she replied.
They looked at each other with unstable feelings, like two scary, snotacular snakes swimming at a very ruthless rave, which had trance music playing in the background and two tight-fisted uncles singing to the beat.
Chantal regarded Sophia's grubby lips and vast elbows. "I don't have the funds ..." she lied.
Sophia glared. "Do you want me to shove that enchanted teapot where the sun don't shine?"
Chantal promptly remembered her giving and adorable values. "Actually, I do have the funds," she admitted. She reached into her pockets. "Here's what I owe you."
Sophia looked concerned, her wallet blushing like a bad, bloody book.
Then Sophia came inside for a nice cup of tea.
